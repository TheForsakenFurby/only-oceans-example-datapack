# Full Information

This is an example datapack for Minecraft Java Edition on custom world generation.

This is the barest-bones interpretation of an "ocean challenge" world. The whole overworld is ocean biomes. No land, no beaches (thus no buried treasure), no mushroom islands, no lush/dripstone/deep dark biomes. Just the 9 vanilla oceans. Terrain generation has been tweaked near the roots so that the entire surface follows the terrain shape of oceans and deep oceans. (Additionally, continentalness noise has been scaled down for playability.)

This datapack has been published for learning purposes — anyone interested is encouraged to download it and look through the files to see how they can do something like this, or even rip files directly (no credit needed). You are of course welcome to actually play with it too, though there is significantly less gameplay than in vanilla.

This datapack should work for all versions from 1.19.4 to 1.21.6 (both inclusive), and is likely to continue to work for many more versions in the future. For earlier versions in this range (and versions in the future), the game will warn you that the pack was made for a different version. That's fine.

This datapack is only guaranteed to work when enabled during world creation. Trying to add it to a world after world creation may break that world and is not recommended. This datapack will not work in combination with many other world generation datapacks.

(Thanks to jacobsjo for suggesting a much more efficient way to tweak terrain shape, Misode for their generators, and the Minecraft Wiki for its information.)
